This current project is to make a website for recipes.

So far it's been a little less than a week and I've learned plenty about HTML
I can now make very basic websites and manipulate/navigate around files
through the terminal (like how im writing this rn!!), which is really fun.

The most fun part about this so far is the creating aspect. what's also
intriguing is now I can understand how websites work, like when u press f12
and look how its built. it's actually really fun lol

(ok i just realized it explicitly said "(You can also do this as a
self-reflection at the end of the project)". i haven't made the project yet
lol. ill be back here again!)
